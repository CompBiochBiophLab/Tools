       "<div class=\"combi_pagedesc\" id=\"intro\"> The dictionary definition of singers states that they are people who use their voice to produce musical sounds through modulation in tone and pitch however a layman’s definition of a singer is worded in a slightly different manner. Singers are people who have always been with us through the joyous times and through the times we’d rather wish we didn’t remember. They have even accompanied us when we have felt like a rebel and done our bit to revolt against the rules. For many, when they have failed to find the words to express their feeling or love, admiration or even exasperation, singers have stepped forward with their songs to lend suitable words to those feelings. The art of singing has been around for centuries, and practically every culture and civilization has had its share of singers. From throaty growls to melodic voices the list of notable singers from around the world would include the names of people like Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, a famous opera singer, and Eddie Vedder, the famous rock singer from the band Pearl Jam. The history of music has also seen people who have been loved for their singing but have also been acknowledged to have had very bad singing voices. What follows now, is a collection of biographies of some of the most memorable singers from around the world which includes their life stories, timelines and some interesting trivia about them. </div>\n",
