Writing is a task that sooner or latter every scientist must face at, and it is always nice to have a guide to start, specially for students.

# Programming:

In general I think that teaching the basics of a language is  enough  to start programming and teach students how to seek on the web to full-fill its  knowledge gaps.

I learned how to program properly once I learned C. A  good approach to c can be the book “A programar se aprendre jugando” (spanish), but I am sure that books to learn c throw games are available in many languages

# python3

There are thousands  or courses available on line, both on youtube and coursera, here I add 3 links, but many conditioners can be taken when choosing a course. I strongly recommend to chose a course with  a teacher which is easily understood and fulfilling your interests.

# R
 
 A basic course that teach how to work with R and Rstudio as if you were using a spreadsheet can be:

I think this course may be interesting for people who don’t have any interest in  programming but they need to do some statistics in its work

But for those who want to go deeper into R here are the basics on R programming, a smooth introduction in the topic is always interesting.

Finally there are courses statistics and R. This course is quite good and interesting,  and it is a good review for people that studied statistics long ago...

# Study methods

This course is based on the book “A mind for numbers” from Barbara Oakley. It is a interesting book that gives some clues about how to face with the tasks of learning. I read the book some time ago and still using somethings.



# Bioinformatics.

 There are many courses on-line and it is difficult choosing one of them. I guess it depends on the interests of everyone.

# Mindfulness

 I know it may seem far from science, but it is far only in appearance. I think it is important to learn how to deal with failures and mindfulness is a tool for it. Learning to stop, take a deep breath  and start again do not harm anyone
