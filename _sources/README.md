# The CBBL tools repository

CBBL tools is a collection of tools that the [CBBL](https://mon.uvic.cat/cbbl) members have developed to help dealing with usual tasks. The repository is not perfect, nor nicely updated... It represents a starting point to face some typical tasks when dealing with bioinformatics, computational chemistry, molecular simulations, etc...

This is a live repository, always to be improved. Either if you are a member of the [CBBL](https://mon.uvic.cat/cbbl) or not, you contribution is more than welcome.
